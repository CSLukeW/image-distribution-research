Run pretrained on CIFAR10.1

Simple 2D dataset to plot decision boundaries
Need some complexity in dataset/model

Does complexity of model affect missclass distribution

Big thing is to get rid of correlation among models
complex networks that learn correct but different functions
Overfitting is an issue

2D dists with difficult shapes
3 depths of models
train and plot decision boundaries
do the histogram


9/14 meeting

get accuracy closer to 100%
balance the classes
adjacent corners not same class (less clear what class the farther we get from dataset)

tasks:

- above
- train same architecture 5x to compare boundaries
- add configuration if possible
